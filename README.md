* RFM Analysis
  Computes Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics to understand customer behavior.

* Customer Segmentation
  Uses K-Means clustering on RFM features to group customers into meaningful segments.

* Product Recommendation System
  Implements item-based collaborative filtering to suggest related products.
